When I first heard of people using a remote server as their development environment, I might have laughed it off. It sounded like a worse experience for the sake of being able to develop on any machine. But how often are you switching machines? _I thought as I closed my work laptop and opened my personal laptop._ A lot of time passed, but eventually I was reminded of [Mosh](https://mosh.org) and it all clicked. I can have my cake (a single development machine) and eat it too (a local experience everywhere). 

Now, there's some caveats because I haven't _really_ made a single development machine, but added another. 🤦🏻‍♂️So, I can't really say yet if there's a benefit to this approach or if I've just made things even more complicated. I can say, however, that it was _fun_.
