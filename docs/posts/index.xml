      <description>In the process of rebasing with preserving a merge commit (git rebase -i -p base_branch), I somehow managed to lose two commits I was trying to squash together.
To find the lost commits, I tried to use a combination of git commands. First, I tried using git fsck --lost-found which returned a list of commits that were &amp;ldquo;dangling&amp;rdquo;. I have no idea how these specific commits got lost to time, but now they were found.</description>
