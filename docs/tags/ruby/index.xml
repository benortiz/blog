      <description>I have a gem that has been giving me trouble lately. It saved me countless hours of dev time upfront, but is beginning to cause me problems now that I want to extend it. I learned quickly how to clone and edit a gem locally using the gem gem_name, path: &#39;path/to/local/gem&#39;, to get the changes I personally needed.
The difficulty came when, for some yet inexplicable reason, it was causing duplicate calls.</description>
