      <description>I have a gem that has been giving me trouble lately. It saved me countless hours of dev time upfront, but is beginning to cause me problems now that I want to extend it. I learned quickly how to clone and edit a gem locally using the gem gem_name, path: &#39;path/to/local/gem&#39;, to get the changes I personally needed.
The difficulty came when, for some yet inexplicable reason, it was causing duplicate calls.</description>

      <description>My third rails engine added to OppSites brought up some interesting challenges. The first two I installed, from Instacart&amp;rsquo;s Open Source repository, were completely self contained in their views. This third one, user_impersonate2, was my first experience with an engine that embedded itself within my own layouts.
While that behavior was necessary and useful, it was surprising when I started getting errors saying previously working path helpers were undefined.
It turns out, there is some sort of main_app that can be appended to a path helper to tell it to use the helper in the context of the &amp;ldquo;main app&amp;rdquo; instead of the engine.</description>
